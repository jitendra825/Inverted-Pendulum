This is the Matlab code for design Swing up & balance Control for Inverted Pendulum
Code written by Jitendra Singh.

IP_code simulation Folder contains 2 .m files such as:
 1. IP_LQR_code.m file to simulate LQR control for balance Inverted Pendulum at the top (@180 degree)
 2. IP_SwingUp_Lqr_Control.m file to simulate Swing up control & LQR for Balance at the top.
other .m functions files are used by above main simulation files for Animation & ODE solving of Inverted Pendulum

To run suimulation:
A) LQR CONTROL FOR BALANCING AT TOP (@180 degree):
1. open IP_LQR_code.m file in MATLAB
2. To simulate it, just run this code

B) SWING UP & LQR CONTROL FOR BALANCING AT TOP
1. open IP_SwingUp_Lqr_Control.m file in MATLAB
2. To simulate it, just run this code
3. this code is written for implementation of Energy based Collocated Partial Feedback Linearization Control for 
Swing UP and LQR Control for balancing at the TOP.
